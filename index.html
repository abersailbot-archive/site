				<h2>Welcome To AberSailbot's Sailbot2013 Site!</h2>
				<p>We are a group of Undergraduate Computer Science and Physics students at Aberystwyth University. We are building an autonomous sailing robot for the <a href="www.sailbot.org">Sailbot</a> competition.</p>
				<p>We've been working on our entry to Sailbot2013 since October last year, and it's almost ready to go, but now we need the money to actually get the boat, and our team out to the USA to compete, and we'd love for you to help us get there!</p>

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>On Sunday Dan and his parents picked up the boat and headed back home to Reading, Louis and Ashley will be meeting him there the day before the flight, and will all travel to the airport together at 4am (4 hours before the flight).</p>
						<p>Over the last couple of days the team (mainly Kamil) have been working on the station keeping code, thanks to the wonders of version control using Git, and now we seem to have got some functioning code, but no way of testing it properly until we get the boat back in the water state-side, so the simulator will have to do.</p>

We checked the weather for Boston next week and found that it's going to be a wopping 30 degrees C, twice the temperature here in Aber.</p>
						<p>We also got a photo of the sub-team we're sending to Boston (and the boat), from yesterdays test:</p>

						<p>Also today Louis finished the sails by adding our URL to them, looking far less empty now:</p>

						3rd Autonomous Test, Logo's & Raspberry Pi
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>In short, today was the best day we've had so far, first off, i noticed at 2am that Raspberry Pi had put our blog entry up on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4109">their site</a>, which got us so much publicity throughout the day, by lunch time we'd already got over 200 unique visitors.</p>
						<p>The Louis got the Raspberry Pi logo finished and onto the sail, and even though it didn't have the green or pink, it still looked great, and after a few pictures and emails to the foundation, they agreed that it looked good, and that we should now focus on perfecting everything else.</p>
						<p>The last great thing for the day was our 3rd autonomous test, we left at about 2 and got back around 5, it couldn't have gone better. With a couple to tunings to the PID we got it sailing perfectly, including tacking, and nothing broke. The code all worked great (no crashes), the rudder stayed attached and the sails stayed attached to the winch, a brilliant test, and overall, a brilliant day.</p>

						Tacking, Bug Fixes, New Rudder Linkage, Extra Bungee &amp; Raspberry Pi Blog
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Over the last few days we've had quite a lot of fixes to do from the previous test. First we knew how how stop the sail winch falling off, by adding an extra piece of bungee cord to keep it tight, so we did that. Then, after a few hours of thought we fixed the rudder linkage by removing the old one, and replacing it with some thick (and strong) copper wire from an old mains cable.</p>
						<p>Next was the more difficult bit, figuring out why the code hadn't worked, which ended up taking us hardly any time at all, it turned out that it was just that some TCP sockets didn't close properly and all we needed to do was turn the control system off and on again.</p>
						<p>Today Kamil added the tacking code using the algorithm we'd discussed, but as of yet, the PID was not tuned correctly, that's a job for are next test which is scheduled for tomorrow (the 31st). I also finished and sent off our blog post submission to the Raspberry Pi website, hopefully should be up in the next few days.</p>

						Second Autonomous Test (ish)
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today was meant to be our second autonomous test, but it didn't exactly go according to plan, first off, the weather, the wind and rain were far higher than we expected, measuring wind speeds of 15kts when we got out the car (although it later calmed down a bit).</p>
<p>Second, we got the boat rigged in record time, but problem, the Python code wasn't reading the GPS, Louis had managed to miss this trip and nobody was sure what had changed.</p>
<p>The code still wasn't working, but despite that we thought we'd make the most of the situation and do another RC test (because we need to be competent at RC sailing just in case), so we got the boat in the water and it was sailing fine ... for the first 5 minutes, then problem number three, the linkage connecting the rudder to its servo came unclipped, so we had no steering, we just had to hope that with some sensible sail control, we could steer it towards land.</p>
<p>This was all good until problem number 4 came into play, the chord which linked the sail winch to the sails lost tension and slipped off the winch, meaning that now we had no rudder or sail control, and the boat was stuck in the middle of the lake</p>
<p>Eventually after about half an hour of waiting the wind eventually managed to blow the boat slowly but surely into reach, we got it out of the water, de-rigged it and brought it back to the lab.</p>
<p>The test wasn't a complete failure though, we got to see the worst case of what COULD go wrong. We later discovered that a simple reboot of the GPS was all that was needed to fix the autonomous code problem, and we came up with solutions to the sail and rudder problems too, but we plan to implement them tomorrow</p>

						First Autonomous Test
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today was a big milestone for us, we finally got the boat out in the marina sailing autonomously, no tacking yet, but it was great to see it finally working after all this time. Considering we seemed to be getting winds far higher than 15kts at which Sailbot is called off, despite a few bumps, some wet shoes and some manual tacking with the RC Remote, we can still call it a great, and generally successful, first autonomous sail. The next test is set for Tuesday at 4pm on the lake</p>

						Cambridge Raspberry Jam &amp; Amazing Sponsorship

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Well, lots went on today, we got to the Jam and after a bit of moving around got to the right room and got setup, got to see a load of really interesting projects using the Pi, and got to meet some of the great people working on the Pi itself. We had our first proper presentation, and although we were nervous, it seemed to go pretty well, we seemed to get our name and message out there, and at the end, we got interviewed by a local radio station, Cambridge 105, which should get us a load of coverage once it airs, and if that wasn't enough, we got approached at the end by someone at the Raspberry Pi Foundation wanting to sponsor us for the competition, which we all thought really was the best possible result we could have hoped for. So overall, an amazing and definitely worthwhile trip.</p>

						<p>Yesterday we finished rewiring the power box, we tested the new rudder servo in its mounting, and tested the sail winch (which was, annoyingly, still going crazy). We also mounted the sail onto the rig for the first time.</p>						
						<img src="img/blog/sailRig.jpg" alt="The sail in place on the boat"/>
						<p>Then Today, finally, we managed to fix the Sail Winch problems we were having by rewiring the rudder servo and the RC receiver to be powered off the sail winch. We also scheduled our first RC test for March 17th, and discovered a slight sail winch tension issue which was, when the sail is put under load, tension can be lost in the system causing the rigging line to fall off the Sail Winch. We also secured the Arduino mounting to the raspberry pi.</p>

						Deliveries, Compass Problems &amp; Making Things Final

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>The new waterproof connectors finally arrived on Monday.</p>
						<img src="img/blog/waterproofConnectorsSmall.jpg" alt="Waterproof Connectors Arrived"/>
						<p>Yesterday we planned to test the compass, but it didn't work, it wasn't returning anything at all, so we spent the rest of the day trying to figure out why, and fix it. We checked the Python and Arduino code for reasons, but it all seemed fine, and worked out eventually that it was an issue with the connection to the compass, or the compass itself. We also laid out the electronics wiring so we know what fits where in which box.</p>
						<img src="img/blog/wiringLayoutSmall.jpg" alt="Wiring Layout"/>
						<p>Then today we managed to diagnose and fix the compass problems we'd been having, it ended up being due to there being a dodgy pin on our Arduino, so we found a replacement, and due to the fact we were using pin headers rather than soldering on the Arduino itself, it took hardly any time.</p>
						<p>We also wired up the wind sensor, epoxied in the compass, and threaded the sail winch tensioning bungee into the rig.</p>

						Yet Another Really Busy Day
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today, once again, we had a really productive day. We drilled all of the waterproof connector holes, and fitted all but 2 of the connectors because the delivery hasn't come yet. We added an LED to the power distribution board so that we can see when it's on better. We also considered putting a waterproof switch outside of the boxes to make it easier to turn the power on and off. Louis tested and rewrote the GPS code to make it more efficient and less buggy. We cabled the XBee box up to the main box.</p>
						<p>Importantly we tested the sail winch and rudder servo with the RC remote, which showed we were getting an abnormal amount of interference in the connection. We diagnosed the problem as either radio interference from the room, power interference from the regulators/batteries, which could be fixed by some bigger resistors, or interference down the cable attaching the servo's to the other boxes, which can be fixed by shortening the cable.</p>

						Another Busy Day
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today was another day that we seemed to do an awful lot. First we realised that the GPS was wired incorrectly, and fixed then tested that. Then we removed the Ground wires from the power distribution board (as it will be common ground out of the battery box and split later once it is in the main box). We also put the first waterproof connector into the battery box, built a new heat-sync for the 5v regulator on the power distribution board (because we realised how hot it was getting) and finally we installed the new Sail Winch and waterproof rudder servo into the deck.</p>

						It's Getting Busy

						<p>Today it feels like we did an awful lot. We tested the new multiplexer and decided that the power distribution board and the battery switch should go into the batteries box. Louis also made the Perspex mounting for the Arduino to the Pi, and the mounting for the Compass into the boat. We epoxied the compass into it's container (almost blowing it up in the process because of the heat), and attached it to it's mounting. We decided on and ordered which waterproof connectors to use, and also the new, fully waterproof rudder servo arrived. Then this morning we wrote some Python code for the Pi that gathered data from all the sensors and logged it to a file. We also decided that the final high-level code will be written in C++ rather than Python.</p>

						<p>We soldered up the multiplexer and the RC receiver, the new batteries arrived (4 batteries at 2200mAh each) so we tested the voltages (about 8/9V when fully charged).</p>

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>This week we connected up the compass for the first time with the new code (now merged into the main Arduino code) and tested it, it worked well giving some reasonably accurate readings, but we took into account that the lab has a lot of magnetic interference.</p>
						<p>Wednesday morning the refurbishment subteam finished adding the new deck to the hull and adding the first layer of paint. Ashley also built the power distribution board with some resistors, a 5v regulator and a 3.3 volt regulator, which, as suspected, fixed the problems we found at the Mach Pi Jam. We also ordered a box for the batteries which is exactly the same as the main box.</p>

						<p>Today we took the boat, and the electronics so far, out to the Machynlleth Raspberry Jam to gain some publicity for the project. Whilst we were there we did an initial range test for the RC remote, which was 100m through a brick wall). Whilst demonstrating we discovered a bug, where the pi restarts when the servo turns due to power spikes, higher current and some capacitors on the power supply should fix the problem.</p>

						Planning, Planning, and some Comms
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>The last few weeks have been about planning, we had a meeting to coordinate who would be doing what programming. Louis was designated the low level Python side on the Pi because he has previous experience, Dave was designated the high level Python side because he has experience with sailing and high level logic, Ashley was designated to do the C++ side on the Arduino and Kamil was chosen to do the telemetry side on the laptop to be used from the shore.</p>
						<p>In another meeting we calculated the power budget and put it all onto the GitHub wiki. We designed a rough layout for the hardware inside the boat, chose the Peli 1060 waterproof box to keep the electronics dry and chose the 'Pololu RC Servo 4 Channel Multiplexer' to switch between radio control, and automatic control by the Pi/Arduino.</p>
						<p>And finally this afternoon we got a spare Arduino hooked up to a spare Raspberry Pi via USB and got some primitive communications between the 2. Overall, a pretty good few weeks I think.</p>

						<p>This week we went to the Digital Systems Lab for our first look at a potential boat hull. It needs some serious restoration and a new deck, but it seems strong enough and the right size for what we need.</p>
						<p>The restoration subteam, consisting of Louis and John, with help from our mentors, started planning out the exact work that needs done on the hull. The old deck needs to be removed, and a new one made and put back onto the boat, a mounting at the back needs adding for the rudder, and a slot for the mast needs to installed.</p>
