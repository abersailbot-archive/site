				<h2>Welcome To AberSailbot's Sailbot2013 Site!</h2>
				<p>We are a group of Undergraduate Computer Science and Physics students at Aberystwyth University. We are building an autonomous sailing robot for the <a href="www.sailbot.org">Sailbot</a> competition.</p>
				<p>We've been working on our entry to Sailbot2013 since October last year, and it's almost ready to go, but now we need the money to actually get the boat, and our team out to the USA to compete, and we'd love for you to help us get there!</p>

						Cambridge Raspberry Pi Jam &AMP; Amazing Sponsorship

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Well, lots went on today, we got to the Jam and after a bit of moving around got to the right room and got setup, got to see a load of really interesting projects using the Pi, and got to meet some of the great people working on the Pi itself. We had our first proper presentation, and although we were nervous, it seemed to go pretty well, we seemed to get our name and message out there, and at the end, we got interviewed by a local radio station, Cambridge 105, which should get us a load of coverage once it airs, and if that wasn't enough, we got approached at the end by someone at the Raspberry Pi Foundation wanting to sponsor us for the competition, which we all thought really was the best possible result we could have hoped for. So overall, an amazing and definitely worthwhile trip.</p>

						Yet Another Really Busy Day

						<p>Today, once again, we had a really productive day. We drilled all of the waterproof connector holes, and fitted all but 2 of the connectors because the delivery hasn't come yet. We added an LED to the power distribution board so that we can see when it's on better. We also considered putting a waterproof switch outside of the boxes to make it easier to turn the power on and off. Louis tested and rewrote the GPS code to make it more efficient and less buggy. We cabled the XBee box up to the main box.</p>
						<p>Importantly we tested the sail winch and rudder servo with the RC remote, which showed we were getting an abnormal amount of interference in the connection. We diagnosed the problem as either radio interference from the room, power interference from the regulators/batteries, which could be fixed by some bigger resistors, or interference down the cable attaching the servo's to the other boxes, which can be fixed by shortening the cable.</p>

We also put the first waterproof connector into the battery box, built a new heat-sync for the 5v regulator on the power distribution board (because we realised how hot it was getting) and finally we installed the new Sail Winch and waterproof rudder servo into the deck.</p>

						<p>This afternoon we soldered up the multiplexer and the RC receiver, tested the battery voltage, did a hull floatation test in the pond outside the lab (it floats!), and Daniel accidentally blew up the multiplexer (by connecting + into - and - into +).</p>

						Compass &AMP; Power board
					</div>
					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today we connected up the compass for the first time with the new code and tested it, it worked well giving some reasonably accurate readings, but we took into account that the lab has a lot of magnetic interference. Ashley also built the power distribution board with some resistors, a 5v regulator and a 3.3 volt regulator, which, as suspected, fixed the problems we found at the Mach Pi Jam. We also ordered a box for the batteries which is exactly the same as the main box.</p>

						Machynlleth Raspberry Jam

					<div class="postContent">
						<p>Today we took the boat, and the electronics so far, out to the Machynlleth Raspberry Jam to gain some publicity for the project. Whilst we were there we did an initial range test for the RC remote, which was 100m through a brick wall). Whilst demonstrating we discovered a bug, where the pi restarts when the servo turns due to power spikes, higher current and some capacitors on the power supply should fix the problem.</p>
